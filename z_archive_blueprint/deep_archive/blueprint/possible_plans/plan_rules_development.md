# COBOL to Java Migration: Rules Development Plan

Date: May 25, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines our strategic approach to developing and managing migration rules for COBOL to Java conversion. With established workflows in place, our focus shifts to creating, refining, and maintaining the rules that guide consistent and effective migration patterns.

After analyzing the COBOL programs (INQACC.cbl, CREACC.cbl, etc.), we've identified that a comprehensive rule system is essential for ensuring consistent code quality, proper type handling, naming conventions, and architectural patterns across all migrations.

### 1.1. Rules-Driven Migration Philosophy

Our migration success depends on well-defined rules that:

1. **Ensure Consistency** - All migrated code follows the same patterns and conventions
2. **Reduce Decision Fatigue** - Clear guidelines eliminate repetitive architectural decisions
3. **Maintain Quality** - Established patterns promote best practices and reduce errors
4. **Enable Scalability** - Standardized approaches allow for efficient team scaling

### 1.2. Iterative Rules Development Strategy

1. **Foundation Rules (Priority 1)**  
   1. **`cobol_java_type_mapping.md`** – **already drafted**; ensures type correctness across DTOs, repositories, and tests.  
   2. **`naming_structure.md`** *(minimal scope)* – defines class/package naming and basic layer suffixes for consistent file organization.

2. **Apply & Validate** – Use foundation rules during migration tasks; capture gaps and inconsistencies.

3. **Expand & Refine** – Based on real migration experiences, add new rules (REST API patterns, testing conventions, service-layer structure, etc.) and refine existing ones.

## 2. Rule Categories and Priorities

### 2.1. Foundation Rules (Priority 1 - Essential)

These rules form the core foundation and must be established before any significant migration work:

1. **Type Mapping Rules** (`cobol_java_type_mapping.md`)
   1. COBOL PIC clauses to Java types
   2. Decimal precision handling
   3. Date/time format conversions
   4. Binary and packed decimal handling

2. **Naming Convention Rules** (`naming_structure.md`)
   1. Package structure standards
   2. Class naming patterns (Service, Repository, DTO, Controller)
   3. Method naming conventions
   4. Variable and field naming standards

### 2.2. Structural Rules (Priority 2 - Architecture)

These rules define how Java applications should be structured:

1. **Service Layer Structure** (`service_layer_structure.md`)
   1. Service class organization
   2. Business logic separation
   3. Error handling patterns
   4. Transaction management approaches

2. **Data Access Patterns** (`data_access_patterns.md`)
   1. Repository interface standards
   2. Entity relationship mapping
   3. Query optimization guidelines
   4. Connection management

### 2.3. API and Integration Rules (Priority 3 - Interface)

These rules govern external interfaces and API design:

1. **REST API Patterns** (`rest_api_patterns.md`)
   1. Endpoint naming conventions
   2. HTTP status code usage
   3. Request/response formatting
   4. Swagger/OpenAPI documentation standards

2. **Error Handling Standards** (`error_handling_standards.md`)
   1. Exception hierarchy design
   2. Error response formatting
   3. Logging and monitoring patterns
   4. User-friendly error messages

## 3. Migration Rules

*(Rule files live in `.windsurf/rules/`)*

### 3.1. Starter Rules (Phase 3 kickoff)

1. **cobol_java_type_mapping.md** – Trigger `model_decision`, **draft complete** ✔.  
2. **naming_structure.md** – _Minimal naming conventions_, **draft pending**.

### 3.2. Rules to be Added After First Workflow Run

1. **rest_api_patterns.md** – Endpoint naming, status handling, Swagger annotations.  
2. **testing_conventions.md** – Unit/integration test templates, coverage goals.  
3. **service_layer_structure.md** – Standard layering and error patterns.

### 3.3. Rule Governance & Iteration

1. Rules and workflow evolve **together**; update whichever is impacted first and commit both.  
2. Review rule effectiveness after each migration sprint and refine.  
3. Keep each rule < 6000 chars and tag with clear descriptions for Cascade UI.

## 4. Open Questions

1. **REDEFINES Handling**
   1. What's the most effective way to handle COBOL REDEFINES clauses in Java?
   2. Should we use multiple attributes with conversion methods or another approach?

2. **CICS Command Mapping**
   1. How should we map complex CICS database commands to Spring/JDBC operations?
   2. What patterns work best for transaction management?

3. **Performance Considerations**
   1. Are there specific performance patterns we should apply for high-volume operations?
   2. How should we handle batch processing scenarios?

## 5. Rules Implementation and Refinement Plan

### 5.1. Foundation Phase (Current Priority)

1. **Complete Foundation Rules** – finalize cobol type-mapping (✔) + complete naming structure rule.  
2. **Validate Through Migration** – apply rules during INQACC.cbl migration, capture gaps and inconsistencies.  
3. **Document Rule Effectiveness** – track which rules prevented issues vs. which need refinement.

### 5.2. Continuous Rules Evolution

1. **After Each Migration Sprint**
   1. Review rule effectiveness and identify gaps
   2. Document new patterns or edge cases encountered
   3. Refine existing rules for clarity and completeness
   4. Update rule documentation with examples and rationale

2. **Quarterly Rule Reviews**
   1. Assess overall rule system coherence
   2. Identify redundancies or conflicts between rules
   3. Prioritize new rules based on migration needs
   4. Archive or consolidate rules that are no longer needed

## 7. Rules Success Criteria

1. **Rule Effectiveness**
   1. Rules provide clear, actionable guidance for common migration scenarios
   2. Rule application results in consistent code patterns across migrations
   3. Rules eliminate repeated architectural decisions and reduce migration time

2. **Code Quality Impact**
   1. Code generated using rules passes all tests consistently
   2. Rule-guided migrations match original COBOL functionality
   3. All migrated code follows established Java and Spring best practices

3. **Rule System Quality**
   1. Rules are clear, unambiguous, and easy to follow
   2. Rule conflicts are identified and resolved quickly
   3. Rule coverage addresses the majority of migration scenarios encountered

## 8. Rules Development Process

1. **Rule Creation Process**
   1. Identify migration patterns that require standardization
   2. Research Java/Spring best practices for the pattern
   3. Create rule draft with clear examples and rationale
   4. Test rule application in real migration scenarios
   5. Refine rule based on practical application results
   6. Document rule with examples, exceptions, and decision rationale

2. **Rule Maintenance Process**
   1. Monitor rule effectiveness during migrations
   2. Collect feedback on rule clarity and applicability
   3. Update rules when new patterns or edge cases emerge
   4. Ensure rule consistency across the entire rule system
   5. Archive or consolidate rules that become obsolete
   6. Maintain rule versioning and change documentation
