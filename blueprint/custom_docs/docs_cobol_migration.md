Modernizing a main-frame/COBOL estate is rarely a “code-translation-only” project. Successful programs tackle **eight tightly-coupled work-streams**—one of which is a deliberate **data-store transition** that moves (or safely virtualizes) decades of VSAM, IMS & Db2 data. Below is a pragmatic checklist you can reuse when scoping a migration to Java, .NET, or cloud-native services.

## 1\. Baseline assessment & road-mapping

-   Inventory every application, batch job, copybook, dataset and interface; score them for business criticality, tech debt and change frequency [Swimm](https://swimm.io/learn/mainframe-modernization/mainframe-migration-5-strategies-and-5-tips-for-success).
    
-   Choose an overall path—rehost, refactor, replace, retire, or wrap—often mixing approaches per workload [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/infrastructure/mainframe-migration/application-strategies).
    
-   Define KPIs (cost per MIPS, release cadence, RTO/RPO, test pass-rate) to prove value incrementally.
    

## 2\. Application-code modernization

-   **Replatform / lift-and-shift** emulates CICS & JCL on Linux or cloud runtimes while keeping COBOL intact (fastest, least change) [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/infrastructure/mainframe-migration/application-strategies).
    
-   **Refactor or auto-transpile** tools (AWS Blu Age, Astadia, Micro Focus, AWS Transform) generate Java/C# and micro-service scaffolds, injecting unit-test harnesses and CI templates out-of-the-box [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transform/latest/userguide/transform-app-mainframe.html)[bluage.com](https://www.bluage.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
-   **Parallel run (“Dual Run”)** lets new code shadow production for months, de-risking the final cut-over [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure-modernization/dual-run-by-google-cloud-helps-mitigate-mainframe-migration-risks).
    

## 3\. Data-store transition (the piece you asked about)

| Legacy layer | Modern targets | Typical pattern | Enablers / tools | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VSAM/SEQ files | Amazon RDS, PostgreSQL, SQL Server | **CDC-based replication** keeps VSAM and the RDBMS in sync until cut-over [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/migrate-and-replicate-vsam-files-to-amazon-rds-or-amazon-msk-using-connect-from-precisely.html)[Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/mainframe-modernization/capabilities/data-replication/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | Precisely Connect, Qlik Attunity, IBM Replication | Enables SQL analytics, off-main-frame batch, cheaper storage |
| IMS hierarchical DB | NoSQL (Cassandra, DynamoDB) or document DB | **Model-first refactor**—flatten segments into JSON docs, expose via REST | Blu Age data transformer, LzLabs SDM [Medium](https://medium.com/%40adnanmasood/from-iron-giants-to-cloud-powerhouses-a-blueprint-for-the-re-platforming-of-legacy-mainframe-and-31c53adea402?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | Removes hierarchical lock-in, supports micro-service autonomy |
| Db2 for z/OS | Cloud RDBMS (Azure SQL, Cloud Spanner), or remain Db2 via data virtualization | **Lift-as-is** or **virtualize**; many orgs leave Db2 but expose it through federated queries [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/infrastructure/mainframe-migration/application-strategies)[IBM Redbooks](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg248044.pdf) | IBM Data Virtualization, Denodo, Azure Data Factory | Lowers risk; preserves rich SQL + ACID semantics |
| Tape/flat archives | Object storage (S3, Azure Blob) + lakehouse tables (Parquet/Iceberg) | **Bulk ETL then incremental CDC** | AWS DMS, Azure Data Factory, GCP BigQuery Transfer | Cheap retention; unlocks ML & lakehouse analytics |
| *Design tactics* |  |  |  |  |

1.  **Schema evolution & versioning**—carry both COBOL copybook layouts and new DDL during dual-run to avoid broken consumers [Swimm](https://swimm.io/learn/mainframe-modernization/mainframe-migration-5-strategies-and-5-tips-for-success).
    
2.  **Side-by-side performance testing**—Dual Run or similar lets you benchmark query latencies before flipping the system-of-record flag [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure-modernization/dual-run-by-google-cloud-helps-mitigate-mainframe-migration-risks).
    
3.  **Cut-over windows**—most banks pick a low-volume weekend and rely on CDC-lags < 5 seconds to drain queues, then freeze VSAM writes and point apps to the new DB.
    

## 4\. Integration & API layer

Expose COBOL transactions through REST/GraphQL gateways or event streams (Kafka/MSK) so that new micro-services can coexist while the monolith shrinks [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/migrate-and-replicate-vsam-files-to-amazon-rds-or-amazon-msk-using-connect-from-precisely.html)[help.precisely.com](https://help.precisely.com/r/n/AWS-Mainframe-Modernization/pub/Latest/en-US/AWS-Mainframe-Modernization-Data-Replication-for-IBM-z/OS/PostgreSQL-Sink-configuration-example?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## 5\. CI/CD & automated testing

Introduce Git-based version control, JUnit/TestNG harnesses for converted code, containerised build agents, and synthetic data packs so every refactor is regression-tested on commit [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transform/latest/userguide/transform-app-mainframe.html).

## 6\. Infrastructure & runtime shift

-   Early phases often stay on-prem with emulators; later phases containerise or deploy to managed runtimes (EKS, AKS, GKE).
    
-   Cloud providers bundle landing-zones (VPC, IAM, monitoring) specifically for mainframe workloads (AWS Mainframe Modernization service, Azure CAF templates) [Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/mainframe-modernization/)[Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/infrastructure/mainframe-migration/application-strategies).
    

## 7\. Observability, security & governance

Centralised logging/metrics, IAM-backed secrets, and zero-trust network policies must be retro-fitted; many teams run both legacy SMF logs and Prometheus/New Relic until decommission [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/migrate-and-replicate-vsam-files-to-amazon-rds-or-amazon-msk-using-connect-from-precisely.html).

## 8\. Change-management & up-skilling

-   Cross-train COBOL engineers in Java & cloud pipelines.
    
-   Run dual-stack releases so business users feel no disruption.
    
-   Iterate with a “strangler-fig” pattern—route a little traffic at a time and retire dead code as confidence grows [Swimm](https://swimm.io/learn/mainframe-modernization/mainframe-migration-5-strategies-and-5-tips-for-success).

### Quick answers to your specific question

*Yes—**data-store transition is a first-class work-stream**.* Whether you simply replicate VSAM into an RDBMS, virtualise Db2, or redesign schemas entirely, a concrete data plan is essential for performance, analytics, and future agility. Most programmes sequence it alongside code refactoring so tests cover both layers in lock-step.
