## Next Steps

1. **DECISION POINT**: Which option do you prefer?
   - Option A: Complete rebuild (recommended)
   - Option B: Incremental fix
   - Option C: Hybrid approach

2. **IMPLEMENTATION**: Once decided, I can implement the chosen solution immediately

3. **VALIDATION**: Run SonarQube analysis to verify coverage improvements

The current testing framework is beyond repair - it's providing false confidence while delivering zero actual value. A complete rebuild is the cleanest path to achieving your SonarQube coverage goals.

## User Preferences for Testing Initiative (Learned During Rebuild)

### Approach Preferences
- **Foundation First**: Fix governance issues before building tests ("Why build strong tests on a broken scaffold?")
- **Minimal but Solid**: Build "mini version" with extensible foundation rather than comprehensive initial implementation
- **Template-Driven**: Create patterns that serve as template for all 26 COBOL program migrations
- **Concise Communication**: Prefers non-verbose, direct communication and clarifying questions

### Technical Preferences
- **Multi-Tier Database Strategy**: Three database types for different testing needs:
  - **H2 In-Memory**: Fast unit-style repository tests, CI pipeline tests
  - **Test SQLite** (`test-banking.db`): Integration tests, migration verification, complex business logic
  - **Production SQLite** (`banking.db`): Read-only manual testing, data migration validation, performance benchmarking
- **Test Data**: Adapt existing `TestDataGenerator` (583 lines of business logic) rather than rewrite
- **Test Architecture**: Hybrid base class approach (lightweight unit base, shared integration base)
- **Coverage Tools**: JaCoCo for coverage reporting (questioned necessity of SonarQube complexity)

### Database Selection Decision Framework
1. **Speed needed?** → H2 In-Memory
2. **Schema compatibility critical?** → Test SQLite
3. **Real data volumes needed?** → Production SQLite (read-only only)
4. **Complex business logic?** → Test SQLite
5. **CI/CD pipeline?** → H2 for speed

### Test Types Required (Mini Framework)
1. **Unit Test**: Pure logic testing (no DB dependencies)
2. **Integration Test**: Real HTTP endpoints + SQLite + repositories  
3. **Migration Verification Test**: COBOL vs Java logic and data transformation validation
4. **Repository Test**: Database layer with SQL execution validation

### Quality Standards
- **Coverage Monitoring**: Yes, but no strict quality gates initially
- **Test Isolation**: Clean setup/teardown with separate test DB
- **Extensibility**: Framework must scale to support remaining 25 COBOL programs
- **Real Testing**: Integration tests with actual HTTP + DB, avoid heavy mocking that masks issues

### Migration Context
- **Scale**: Foundation for migrating 26 COBOL programs total
- **Timing**: Build test framework before application complexity increases
- **Success Criteria**: All four test types working, coverage functional, extensible patterns established
