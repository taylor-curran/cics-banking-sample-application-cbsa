# COBOL to Java Migration Plan

Date: May 24, 2025
Last Updated: May 24, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed plan for migrating the CICS Banking Sample Application (CBSA) from COBOL/CICS to a Java-based implementation. The plan takes into account our limited COBOL/CICS knowledge and prioritizes simpler components for initial migration to build momentum and understanding.

## 2. Migration Approach

We'll adopt an **incremental migration** approach with the following characteristics:

- **Start Small**: Begin with simpler, self-contained programs before tackling complex ones
- **Incremental Delivery**: Migrate and test one component at a time
- **Knowledge Building**: Use early migrations to establish patterns for later, more complex programs
- **Focus on Learning**: Document discoveries about the COBOL structure to aid future migrations

## 3. Technology Stack

### Target Architecture

- **Runtime**: Java 11 with Spring Boot
- **API Layer**: RESTful services that mirror the functionality of COBOL programs
- **Database**: SQLite with JDBC (plain SQL, no ORM)
- **Testing**: JUnit 5 + Mockito
- **Build System**: Maven
- **Deployment**: Self-contained JAR

## 4. Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Environment Setup and Data Model (Weeks 1-2) - âœ… MAIN TASKS COMPLETED

1. **Set up Java/Spring Boot Development Environment** âœ…

   1. Set up Maven project structure
   2. Configure Spring Boot starter dependencies

2. **Define Java Data Models** âœ…

   1. Create Java classes for core entities based on COBOL copybooks:
      1. `Account` (from ACCOUNT.cpy)
      2. `Customer` (from CUSTOMER.cpy)
      3. `Transaction` (from PROCTRAN.cpy)
      4. `Control` (from CONTROLI.cpy)
   2. Include proper validation annotations

3. **Create SQLite Database Schema** âœ…

   1. Design relational schema based on COBOL data structures
   2. Create SQL scripts for table creation
   3. Implement basic JDBC repository classes
   4. Created REST API endpoints for status and data management

4. **Develop Test Data Generator** âœ…

   1. Create script to generate realistic test data
   2. Include capabilities for database reset
   3. Generate sample customer and account data
   4. Successfully tested with command: `mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--generate-test-data=true --customer-count=10 --accounts-per-customer=2 --transactions-per-account=5 --reset-database=true" -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dserver.port=8085"`

5. **Phase 1 Completion Tasks** ðŸ”„

   1. Add basic integration tests for the repository layer
   2. Review SQL schema for any needed optimizations
   3. Document existing API endpoints with Swagger/OpenAPI

### Phase 1 Technical Insights

1. **SQLite Implementation Discoveries**

   1. SQLite has reserved keywords (like "transaction") that required table name adjustments
   2. Spring Data JDBC doesn't work well with SQLite; plain JDBC repositories are more reliable
   3. SQLite data types differ from standard SQL, requiring careful mapping

2. **Java Implementation Successes**

   1. REST API structure with separate controllers for status and data management works well
   2. Application runs successfully as a backend service with API endpoints
   3. Test data generation is critical for validating functionality

3. **Architecture Validation**

   1. The Spring Boot architecture with separate controllers, services, and repositories provides a clean separation of concerns
   2. Java model classes successfully map to COBOL data structures
   3. REST API approach is suitable for replacing CICS transaction processing
