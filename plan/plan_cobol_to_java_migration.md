# COBOL to Java Migration Plan

Date: May 24, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed plan for migrating the CICS Banking Sample Application (CBSA) from COBOL/CICS to a Java-based implementation. The plan takes into account our limited COBOL/CICS knowledge and prioritizes simpler components for initial migration to build momentum and understanding.

## 2. Migration Approach

We'll adopt an **incremental migration** approach with the following characteristics:

- **Start Small**: Begin with simpler, self-contained programs before tackling complex ones
- **Incremental Delivery**: Migrate and test one component at a time
- **Knowledge Building**: Use early migrations to establish patterns for later, more complex programs
- **Focus on Learning**: Document discoveries about the COBOL structure to aid future migrations

## 3. Technology Stack

### Target Architecture

- **Runtime**: Java 11 with Spring Boot
- **API Layer**: RESTful services that mirror the functionality of COBOL programs
- **Database**: SQLite with JDBC (plain SQL, no ORM)
- **Testing**: JUnit 5 + Mockito
- **Build System**: Maven
- **Deployment**: Self-contained JAR

## 4. Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Environment Setup and Data Model (Weeks 1-2)

1. **Set up Java/Spring Boot Development Environment**
   - Set up Maven project structure
   - Configure Spring Boot starter dependencies

2. **Define Java Data Models**
   - Create Java classes for core entities based on COBOL copybooks:
     - `Account` (from ACCOUNT.cpy)
     - `Customer` (from CUSTOMER.cpy)
     - `Transaction` (from PROCTRAN.cpy)
     - `Control` (from CONTROLI.cpy)
   - Include proper validation annotations

3. **Create SQLite Database Schema**
   - Design relational schema based on COBOL data structures
   - Create SQL scripts for table creation
   - Implement basic JDBC repository classes

4. **Develop Test Data Generator**
   - Create script to generate realistic test data
   - Include capabilities for database reset
   - Generate sample customer and account data

### Phase 2: Utility Functions Migration (Weeks 3-4)

1. **Migrate Simple Utility Programs**
   - Start with smallest, self-contained programs like:
     - GETSCODE.cbl (retrieve sort codes)
     - GETCOMPY.cbl (retrieve company information)
   - Create equivalent Java service methods
   - Write unit tests to verify behavior

2. **Establish Common Helper Functions**
   - Date/time conversions between COBOL and Java formats
   - Field validations and formatting
   - Error handling utilities

3. **Define REST API Controllers**
   - Create initial REST endpoints for utility functions
   - Document API using Swagger/OpenAPI
   - Write integration tests for endpoints

### Phase 3: Basic Account Functions (Weeks 5-8)

1. **Inquiry Functions**
   - Migrate INQACC.cbl (account inquiry)
   - Implement account lookup functionality
   - Create read-only endpoints first

2. **Account Creation**
   - Migrate CREACC.cbl (account creation)
   - Implement account creation service
   - Include business validation rules

3. **Account Update and Deletion**
   - Migrate UPDACC.cbl (account update)
   - Migrate DELACC.cbl (account deletion)
   - Ensure proper validation and error handling

### Phase 4: Customer Management (Weeks 9-12)

1. **Customer Inquiry**
   - Migrate INQCUST.cbl (customer inquiry)
   - Implement customer lookup functionality

2. **Customer Creation and Management**
   - Migrate CRECUST.cbl (customer creation)
   - Migrate UPDCUST.cbl (customer update)
   - Migrate DELCUS.cbl (customer deletion)

### Phase 5: Financial Operations (Weeks 13-16)

1. **Transaction Processing**
   - Migrate DBCRFUN.cbl (debit/credit functionality)
   - Implement transaction posting logic

2. **Transfer Functions**
   - Migrate XFRFUN.cbl (transfer functionality)
   - Implement transfer between accounts
   - Ensure proper transaction handling

### Phase 6: Menu and Integration (Weeks 17-20)

1. **Main Menu Functionality**
   - Migrate BNKMENU.cbl to Java controller
   - Connect UI components to backend services

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Develop end-to-end test scenarios
   - Validate complete business processes
   - Test boundary conditions and error handling

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Benchmark Java implementation
   - Identify and resolve bottlenecks

### Phase 7: Data Migration and Final Deployment (Weeks 21-24)

1. **Data Migration Tools**
   - Create scripts to migrate data from COBOL structures to SQLite
   - Verify data integrity after migration

2. **Deployment Process**
   - Finalize deployment approach
   - Create deployment documentation
   - Set up continuous integration pipeline

3. **Transition Planning**
   - Define detailed component transition steps
   - Create verification procedures
   - Establish success criteria for each component

## 5. Common COBOL to Java Conversion Patterns

### Data Type Conversions

| COBOL Type | Java Type | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| PIC X(n) | String | Fixed-length character fields |
| PIC 9(n) | Integer, Long | Numeric fields without decimals |
| PIC 9(n)V9(m) | BigDecimal | Numeric fields with decimals |
| PIC S9(n)V9(m) | BigDecimal | Signed numeric fields with decimals |
| COMP-3 | BigDecimal | Packed decimal format |
| 88-level | Boolean or enum | Condition names translated to constants |

### COBOL Structural Elements

| COBOL Concept | Java Equivalent | Implementation Approach |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| COPY | Import/Include | Java class imports |
| REDEFINES | Multiple classes/views | Separate classes with converters |
| OCCURS | Arrays/Lists | Java collections |
| WORKING-STORAGE | Class fields | Static or instance variables |
| PROCEDURE DIVISION | Methods | Service and controller methods |
| CICS Commands | Spring components | REST controllers, services, etc. |

## 6. Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Each Java service method will have comprehensive unit tests
- Use JUnit 5 for test framework
- Use Mockito to mock dependencies
- Target high test coverage (>80%)

### Integration Testing

- Test complete business processes
- Validate API endpoints with Spring MockMvc
- Use SQLite in-memory database for tests

### Test Data Management

- Develop data generation scripts for all entities
- Create known test scenarios with predictable outcomes
- Include boundary conditions and error cases

## 7. Documentation Requirements

1. **Code Documentation**
   - Javadoc comments for all classes and methods
   - Clear mapping between COBOL programs and Java components
   - Document business rules and validation logic

2. **API Documentation**
   - OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
   - Include example requests and responses

3. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Component diagrams
   - Data flow descriptions
   - Integration points

## 8. Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Incomplete understanding of COBOL logic | High | High | Start with simpler components, document findings, seek expert consultation when needed |
| Data conversion issues | High | Medium | Create validation tools, test with representative data samples |
| Performance problems in Java implementation | Medium | Low | Include performance tests, optimize critical paths |
| Missing edge cases in business logic | Medium | Medium | Thorough testing, document all business rules |
| Dependency on external systems | Low | Low | Identify and isolate external dependencies early |

## 9. Key Success Metrics

1. **Functional Completeness**
   - All COBOL program functionality successfully migrated
   - No regressions in business logic

2. **Code Quality**
   - Test coverage percentage
   - Static analysis results
   - Documentation completeness

3. **Performance**

   - Resource utilization within acceptable limits

## 10. Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
