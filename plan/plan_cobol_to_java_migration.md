# COBOL to Java Migration Plan

Date: May 24, 2025
Last Updated: May 24, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed plan for migrating the CICS Banking Sample Application (CBSA) from COBOL/CICS to a Java-based implementation. The plan takes into account our limited COBOL/CICS knowledge and prioritizes simpler components for initial migration to build momentum and understanding.

## 2. Migration Approach

We'll adopt an **incremental migration** approach with the following characteristics:

- **Start Small**: Begin with simpler, self-contained programs before tackling complex ones
- **Incremental Delivery**: Migrate and test one component at a time
- **Knowledge Building**: Use early migrations to establish patterns for later, more complex programs
- **Focus on Learning**: Document discoveries about the COBOL structure to aid future migrations

## 3. Technology Stack

### Target Architecture

- **Runtime**: Java 11 with Spring Boot
- **API Layer**: RESTful services that mirror the functionality of COBOL programs
- **Database**: SQLite with JDBC (plain SQL, no ORM)
- **Testing**: JUnit 5 + Mockito
- **Build System**: Maven
- **Deployment**: Self-contained JAR

## 4. Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Environment Setup and Data Model (Weeks 1-2) - ✅ COMPLETED

1. **Set up Java/Spring Boot Development Environment** ✅

   1. Set up Maven project structure
   2. Configure Spring Boot starter dependencies

2. **Define Java Data Models** ✅

   1. Create Java classes for core entities based on COBOL copybooks:
      1. `Account` (from ACCOUNT.cpy)
      2. `Customer` (from CUSTOMER.cpy)
      3. `Transaction` (from PROCTRAN.cpy)
      4. `Control` (from CONTROLI.cpy)
   2. Include proper validation annotations

3. **Create SQLite Database Schema** ✅

   1. Design relational schema based on COBOL data structures
   2. Create SQL scripts for table creation
   3. Implement basic JDBC repository classes
   4. Created REST API endpoints for status and data management

4. **Develop Test Data Generator** ✅

   1. Create script to generate realistic test data
   2. Include capabilities for database reset
   3. Generate sample customer and account data
   4. Successfully tested with command: `mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--generate-test-data=true --customer-count=10 --accounts-per-customer=2 --transactions-per-account=5 --reset-database=true" -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dserver.port=8085"`

5. **Phase 1 Completion Tasks** ✅

   1. Added basic integration tests for the repository layer (Customer and Account)
   2. Reviewed SQL schema and implemented optimizations with additional indexes
   3. Documented existing API endpoints with Swagger/OpenAPI

### Phase 1 Technical Insights

1. **SQLite Implementation Discoveries**

   1. SQLite has reserved keywords (like "transaction") that required table name adjustments
   2. Spring Data JDBC doesn't work well with SQLite; plain JDBC repositories are more reliable
   3. SQLite data types differ from standard SQL, requiring careful mapping
   4. H2 in-memory database works well for integration tests but has compatibility issues with SQLite

2. **Java Implementation Successes**

   1. REST API structure with separate controllers for status and data management works well
   2. Application runs successfully as a backend service with API endpoints
   3. Test data generation is critical for validating functionality
   4. Swagger/OpenAPI documentation provides clear API visibility
   5. Integration tests verify critical repository operations

3. **Architecture Validation**

   1. The Spring Boot architecture with separate controllers, services, and repositories provides a clean separation of concerns
   2. Java model classes successfully map to COBOL data structures
   3. REST API approach is suitable for replacing CICS transaction processing
   4. Integration testing validates database interactions
   5. Maven provides reliable build and test execution

## 5. Common COBOL to Java Conversion Patterns

### Data Type Conversions

| PIC X(n) | String | Fixed-length character fields |
| PIC 9(n) | Integer, Long | Numeric fields without decimals |
| PIC 9(n)V9(m) | BigDecimal | Numeric fields with decimals |
| PIC S9(n)V9(m) | BigDecimal | Signed numeric fields with decimals |
| COMP-3 | BigDecimal | Packed decimal format |
| 88-level | Boolean or enum | Condition names translated to constants |

### COBOL Structural Elements

| COBOL Concept | Java Equivalent | Implementation Approach |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| COPY | Import/Include | Java class imports |
| REDEFINES | Multiple classes/views | Separate classes with converters |
| OCCURS | Arrays/Lists | Java collections |
| WORKING-STORAGE | Class fields | Static or instance variables |
| PROCEDURE DIVISION | Methods | Service and controller methods |
| CICS Commands | Spring components | REST controllers, services, etc. |

## 6. Testing Strategy

2. Validate API endpoints with Spring MockMvc
3. Use SQLite in-memory database for tests

### Test Data Management

1. Develop data generation scripts for all entities
2. Create known test scenarios with predictable outcomes
3. Include boundary conditions and error cases

## 7. Documentation Requirements

1. **Code Documentation**
