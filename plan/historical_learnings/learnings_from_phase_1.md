# Phase 1 Implementation Learnings

Historical Learnings - Not Current Information

Date: May 24, 2025

## Key Insights from Phase 1

### Technical Discoveries

1. **SQLite Constraints**
   - SQLite has reserved keywords (like "transaction") that required table name adjustments
   - Need to be careful with SQLite data types as they differ from standard SQL
   - Spring Data JDBC doesn't work well with SQLite; plain JDBC is more reliable

2. **Java/Spring Boot Configuration**
   - Lombok annotation processing requires explicit Maven configuration
   - Spring's schema initialization tools need customization for SQLite
   - Database configuration is more complex than anticipated

3. **COBOL to Java Mapping**
   - REDEFINES clauses in COBOL require special handling in Java
   - COBOL's hierarchical data structures don't map directly to Java objects
   - PIC clauses with implied decimal points map to BigDecimal in Java

### Process Improvements

1. **Testing Strategy Adjustment**
   - Add unit tests for data model serialization/deserialization
   - Create database schema tests to verify integrity constraints
   - Test repository methods with in-memory SQLite database

2. **Documentation Needs**
   - Document COBOL to Java type mapping patterns for team reference
   - Add comments in Java code explaining COBOL equivalents
   - Create a glossary of CICS terms and their Spring Boot equivalents

## Recommendations for Phase 2

1. **Before Starting Phase 2**
   - Complete the test data generator from Phase 1
   - Add basic integration tests for the repository layer
   - Review SQL schema for any needed optimizations

2. **Approach to CICS Commands**
   - Create a mapping document for common CICS commands to Spring Boot equivalents
   - Start with simplest CICS interactions (RETURN, ABEND) before complex ones
   - Consider creating helper utilities for common CICS patterns

3. **Utility Functions Priority**
   - Start with GETSCODE.cbl and GETCOMPY.cbl as first conversions
   - These provide simple, testable functionality without complex CICS interactions
   - Will establish patterns for future, more complex translations

## Timeline Adjustments

- Phase 1 database setup took longer than anticipated due to SQLite compatibility issues
- Recommend allocating additional time for CICS transaction handling in later phases
- Consider extending Phase 2 to include more comprehensive testing
