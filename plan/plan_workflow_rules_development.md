# COBOL to Java Migration: Workflow and Rules Development Plan

Date: May 25, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines our approach to developing practical workflows and rules for COBOL to Java migration. After analyzing the COBOL programs (INQACC.cbl, CREACC.cbl, etc.), we've determined that a unified migration workflow is more effective than separate workflows for different COBOL constructs (programs, copy books, and sections/paragraphs).

We'll develop two main workflows:

1. **Unified COBOL Business Function Migration Workflow** - For migrating complete business functions in Phases 3-6 (INQACC.cbl, CREACC.cbl, INQCUST.cbl, etc.)

2. **Data Migration Workflow** - Specifically for Phase 7 tasks focused on data transformation from COBOL structures to SQLite

This approach better reflects how we'll actually tackle each migration task in the plan, focusing on implementing business functionality rather than theoretical mappings of COBOL constructs.

## 2. Unified Migration Workflow

### 2.1. Migration Planning and Analysis

1. **Program Analysis**
   1. Identify the program's business purpose and expected behavior
   2. Analyze the program structure (WORKING-STORAGE, LINKAGE, PROCEDURE)
   3. Document the expected inputs and outputs
   4. Identify dependencies on other programs or copy books

2. **Migration Strategy Decision**
   1. Determine the Java service structure (single class vs. multiple classes)
   2. Identify required database interactions
   3. Determine REST API requirements (endpoints, methods, responses)
   4. Create initial test scenarios based on expected behavior

### 2.2. Implementation

1. **Java Structure Creation**
   1. Create service class(es) with appropriate naming
   2. Define DTOs for input/output data structures
   3. Create repository interfaces if database access is needed
   4. Define controller endpoints if external access is required

2. **Core Logic Migration**
   1. Translate business logic from PROCEDURE DIVISION to Java methods
   2. Convert COBOL data types to appropriate Java types
   3. Implement equivalent error handling
   4. Replace CICS commands with Java/Spring equivalents

3. **Testing**
   1. Write unit tests for core business logic
   2. Write integration tests for database interactions
   3. Create API tests for controller endpoints
   4. Verify behavior matches original COBOL program expectations

4. **Documentation and Finalization**
   1. Document REST API endpoints with Swagger/OpenAPI
   2. Add comments linking Java code to original COBOL sections
   3. Update migration progress in project documentation
   4. Create summary of implementation approach and any challenges

### 2.3. Verification and Deployment

1. **Compilation and Running**
   1. Compile all changes to verify no syntax errors
   2. Run the application with the new components
   3. Verify startup with no exceptions

2. **Functional Testing**
   1. Test the migrated functionality through the API
   2. Verify correct data handling and business logic
   3. Test error scenarios and boundary conditions
   4. Compare results with expected behavior

3. **Integration Verification**
   1. Verify interactions with other migrated components
   2. Test end-to-end workflows involving the component
   3. Validate data persistence and retrieval

## 3. Data Migration Workflow

This workflow is specifically for Phase 7 tasks focused on migrating data from COBOL structures to SQLite.

### 3.1. Data Analysis and Mapping

1. **Source Data Analysis**
   1. Identify COBOL data files and formats
   2. Analyze data structure and relationships
   3. Document data types and constraints
   4. Identify special handling requirements (e.g., date formats, numeric fields)

2. **Target Schema Review**
   1. Review SQLite database schema
   2. Confirm field mappings between COBOL and SQLite
   3. Identify potential data type conversion issues
   4. Plan for handling legacy data quirks

### 3.2. Script Development

1. **ETL Script Creation**
   1. Create data extraction scripts from COBOL sources
   2. Develop data transformation logic
   3. Implement SQLite loading procedures
   4. Add error handling and logging

2. **Validation Rules**
   1. Define data validation criteria
   2. Implement validation checks
   3. Create reports for validation failures
   4. Develop correction procedures for invalid data

### 3.3. Migration Execution

1. **Test Migration**
   1. Run migration on sample data
   2. Validate results against expected outcomes
   3. Measure performance and optimize scripts
   4. Document any issues and resolutions

2. **Production Migration**
   1. Create backup of source data
   2. Execute migration scripts
   3. Validate migrated data integrity
   4. Generate migration completion report

### 3.4. Verification and Cleanup

1. **Data Verification**
   1. Compare source and target data counts
   2. Validate critical business data accuracy
   3. Perform application-level data testing
   4. Verify referential integrity

2. **Finalization**
   1. Archive migration scripts and logs
   2. Document any data transformations or special handling
   3. Update application connection settings
   4. Create data dictionary for the migrated database

## 4. Migration Rules

### 4.1. Naming and Structure Rules

1. **Class Naming**
   1. Use CamelCase for all Java classes
   2. Add appropriate suffixes based on responsibility (Service, Repository, Controller)
   3. Name should reflect business functionality rather than COBOL program name

2. **Package Organization**
   1. Group related services in the same package
   2. Separate DTOs, services, and controllers into appropriate packages
   3. Place utility classes in a common package

3. **Code Structure**
   1. Follow Spring Boot best practices for layers (controller, service, repository)
   2. Keep methods focused on single responsibilities
   3. Extract complex logic into helper methods

### 4.2. Data Handling Rules

1. **Type Conversion**
   1. Use the established COBOL-to-Java type mapping (documented in Phase 2)
   2. Handle special cases (REDEFINES, OCCURS) consistently
   3. Apply validation for data constraints

2. **Database Interactions**
   1. Use consistent patterns for database operations
   2. Apply proper transaction management
   3. Handle database errors consistently

3. **Error Handling**
   1. Use appropriate exceptions for different error conditions
   2. Provide meaningful error messages
   3. Return appropriate HTTP status codes from controllers

### 4.3. Testing Rules

1. **Test Coverage**
   1. Write tests for all business logic paths
   2. Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
   3. Include integration tests for database operations

2. **Test Naming and Organization**
   1. Name tests clearly to reflect the scenario being tested
   2. Organize tests to match the structure of the code
   3. Use appropriate test fixtures and mocks

## 5. Open Questions

1. **REDEFINES Handling**
   1. What's the most effective way to handle COBOL REDEFINES clauses in Java?
   2. Should we use multiple attributes with conversion methods or another approach?

2. **CICS Command Mapping**
   1. How should we map complex CICS database commands to Spring/JDBC operations?
   2. What patterns work best for transaction management?

3. **Performance Considerations**
   1. Are there specific performance patterns we should apply for high-volume operations?
   2. How should we handle batch processing scenarios?

## 6. Implementation and Refinement Plan

### 6.1. Phase 3 Application

1. **Initial Workflow Creation**
   1. Document the unified workflow in `.windsurf/workflows/`
   2. Create initial rules in `.windsurf/rules/`

2. **Apply to Phase 3 Migrations**
   1. Follow the workflow for INQACC.cbl migration
   2. Apply the workflow to CREACC.cbl migration
   3. Document any workflow adjustments needed

### 6.2. Continuous Improvement

1. **After Each Migration**
   1. Review the effectiveness of the workflow and rules
   2. Identify any steps that were unclear or unnecessary
   3. Add missing steps or clarify existing ones
   4. Update the workflow and rules documentation

2. **Phase 4 Refinement**
   1. Incorporate learnings from Phase 3 into updated workflows
   2. Expand rules to cover edge cases encountered
   3. Simplify steps that proved unnecessarily complex

## 7. Success Criteria
