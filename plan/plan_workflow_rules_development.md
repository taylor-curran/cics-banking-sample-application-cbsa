# COBOL to Java Migration: Workflow and Rules Development Plan

Date: May 25, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines our approach to developing practical workflows and rules for COBOL to Java migration. After analyzing the COBOL programs (INQACC.cbl, CREACC.cbl, etc.), we've determined that a unified migration workflow is more effective than separate workflows for different COBOL constructs (programs, copy books, and sections/paragraphs).

We'll develop two main workflows:

1. **Unified COBOL Business Function Migration Workflow** - For migrating complete business functions in Phases 3-6 (INQACC.cbl, CREACC.cbl, INQCUST.cbl, etc.)

2. **Data Migration Workflow** - Specifically for Phase 7 tasks focused on data transformation from COBOL structures to SQLite

This approach better reflects how we'll actually tackle each migration task in the plan, focusing on implementing business functionality rather than theoretical mappings of COBOL constructs.

### 1.2. Iterative Rules & Workflow Strategy

1. **Crucial Starter Rules (max 2)**  
   1. **`cobol_java_type_mapping.md`** – **already drafted**; ensures type correctness across DTOs, repositories, and tests.  
   2. **`naming_structure.md`** *(minimal scope)* – defines class/package naming and basic layer suffixes so the first workflow can generate correctly named files.
2. **Starter Workflow** – Draft the *Unified COBOL Business Function Migration* workflow referencing the two starter rules.
3. **Run & Test** – Apply the workflow to migrate **INQACC.cbl** end-to-end; capture issues.
4. **Iterate** – Update existing rules/workflow based on findings and add new rules (REST API patterns, testing conventions, service-layer structure, etc.).

## 2. Unified Migration Workflow

### 2.1. Migration Planning and Analysis

1. **Program Analysis**
   1. Identify the program's business purpose and expected behavior
   2. Analyze the program structure (WORKING-STORAGE, LINKAGE, PROCEDURE)
   3. Document the expected inputs and outputs
   4. Identify dependencies on other programs or copy books

2. **Migration Strategy Decision**
   1. Determine the Java service structure (single class vs. multiple classes)
   2. Identify required database interactions
   3. Determine REST API requirements (endpoints, methods, responses)
   4. Create initial test scenarios based on expected behavior

### 2.2. Implementation

1. **Java Structure Creation**
   1. Create service class(es) with appropriate naming
   2. Define DTOs for input/output data structures
   3. Create repository interfaces if database access is needed
   4. Define controller endpoints if external access is required

2. **Core Logic Migration**
   1. Translate business logic from PROCEDURE DIVISION to Java methods
   2. Convert COBOL data types to appropriate Java types
   3. Implement equivalent error handling
   4. Replace CICS commands with Java/Spring equivalents

3. **Testing**
   1. Write unit tests for core business logic
   2. Write integration tests for database interactions
   3. Create API tests for controller endpoints
   4. Verify behavior matches original COBOL program expectations

4. **Documentation and Finalization**
   1. Document REST API endpoints with Swagger/OpenAPI
   2. Add comments linking Java code to original COBOL sections
   3. Update migration progress in project documentation
   4. Create summary of implementation approach and any challenges

### 2.3. Verification and Deployment

1. **Compilation and Running**
   1. Compile all changes to verify no syntax errors
   2. Run the application with the new components
   3. Verify startup with no exceptions

2. **Functional Testing**
   1. Test the migrated functionality through the API
   2. Verify correct data handling and business logic
   3. Test error scenarios and boundary conditions
   4. Compare results with expected behavior

3. **Integration Verification**
   1. Verify interactions with other migrated components
   2. Test end-to-end workflows involving the component
   3. Validate data persistence and retrieval

## 3. Data Migration Workflow

This workflow is specifically for Phase 7 tasks focused on migrating data from COBOL structures to SQLite.

### 3.1. Data Analysis and Mapping

1. **Source Data Analysis**
   1. Identify COBOL data files and formats
   2. Analyze data structure and relationships
   3. Document data types and constraints
   4. Identify special handling requirements (e.g., date formats, numeric fields)

2. **Target Schema Review**
   1. Review SQLite database schema
   2. Confirm field mappings between COBOL and SQLite
   3. Identify potential data type conversion issues
   4. Plan for handling legacy data quirks

### 3.2. Script Development

1. **ETL Script Creation**
   1. Create data extraction scripts from COBOL sources
   2. Develop data transformation logic
   3. Implement SQLite loading procedures
   4. Add error handling and logging

2. **Validation Rules**
   1. Define data validation criteria
   2. Implement validation checks
   3. Create reports for validation failures
   4. Develop correction procedures for invalid data

### 3.3. Migration Execution

1. **Test Migration**
   1. Run migration on sample data
   2. Validate results against expected outcomes
   3. Measure performance and optimize scripts
   4. Document any issues and resolutions

2. **Production Migration**
   1. Create backup of source data
   2. Execute migration scripts
   3. Validate migrated data integrity
   4. Generate migration completion report

### 3.4. Verification and Cleanup

1. **Data Verification**
   1. Compare source and target data counts
   2. Validate critical business data accuracy
   3. Perform application-level data testing
   4. Verify referential integrity

2. **Finalization**
   1. Archive migration scripts and logs
   2. Document any data transformations or special handling
   3. Update application connection settings
   4. Create data dictionary for the migrated database

## 4. Migration Rules

*(Rule files live in `.windsurf/rules/`)*

### 4.1. Starter Rules (Phase 3 kickoff)

1. **cobol_java_type_mapping.md** – Trigger `model_decision`, **draft complete** ✔.  
2. **naming_structure.md** – _Minimal naming conventions_, **draft pending**.

### 4.2. Rules to be Added After First Workflow Run

1. **rest_api_patterns.md** – Endpoint naming, status handling, Swagger annotations.  
2. **testing_conventions.md** – Unit/integration test templates, coverage goals.  
3. **service_layer_structure.md** – Standard layering and error patterns.

### 4.3. Rule Governance & Iteration

1. Rules and workflow evolve **together**; update whichever is impacted first and commit both.  
2. Review rule effectiveness after each migration sprint and refine.  
3. Keep each rule < 6000 chars and tag with clear descriptions for Cascade UI.

## 5. Open Questions

1. **REDEFINES Handling**
   1. What's the most effective way to handle COBOL REDEFINES clauses in Java?
   2. Should we use multiple attributes with conversion methods or another approach?

2. **CICS Command Mapping**
   1. How should we map complex CICS database commands to Spring/JDBC operations?
   2. What patterns work best for transaction management?

3. **Performance Considerations**
   1. Are there specific performance patterns we should apply for high-volume operations?
   2. How should we handle batch processing scenarios?

## 6. Implementation and Refinement Plan

### 6.1. Phase 3 Application

1. **Crucial Starter Rules** – cobol type-mapping (✔) + minimal naming rule.  
2. **Author Starter Workflow** – `unified_cobol_business_function_migration.workflow.md` referencing the two rules.  
3. **Run on INQACC.cbl**, capture results, then refine rules/workflow before next migration.

### 6.2. Continuous Improvement

1. **After Each Migration**
   1. Review the effectiveness of the workflow and rules
   2. Identify any steps that were unclear or unnecessary
   3. Add missing steps or clarify existing ones
   4. Update the workflow and rules documentation

2. **Phase 4 Refinement**
   1. Incorporate learnings from Phase 3 into updated workflows
   2. Expand rules to cover edge cases encountered
   3. Simplify steps that proved unnecessarily complex

## 7. Success Criteria
